<h1 align= "left"><b>Motivation💭💭 </b></h1>

It came from looking people dropping their education carrer in mid, couldn't afford or getting inadequate education due to frustation of making available the proper edu-resoures💹!.
<p align= "center"><img width=50% src="./frustation.gif"></p>

So, we tried to put together the required things through this application so that needies could avail the edu-resources with no worry.
<p align= "center"><img width=40% src="./getting_things_done.gif"></p>

There are numerous edu-resources required during student life getting everthing with ease isn't possible. We thought it as <b>Resources which have no importance in your life right now, might be a GEM for someone else.</b> So, we welcome both the sellers/donars and buyers/receivers to sign up a deal and resolve each others problem.
<p align= "center"><img width=50% src="lets_get_it_done.gif"></p>

Its the 4th <b>SDG</b> listed by <b>UN</b> as <b>QUALITY EDUCATION</b> to provide better education all around the globe.

<h1 align= "left"><b>Our Solution🏗 </b></h1>

<p align= "center"><img width=28% src="giphy-downsized.gif"></p>


We propose an app with the vision to connect the people who are in search of edu-resources and those who love to donate or sell there old edu-resources. It will need just a one step verification and will ask the seller to upload there resources with details and contact info. The buyer will explore the resources as per his/her need. And will make contact with the seller if he/she like to make the purchase.
