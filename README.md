There are numerous edu-resources required during student life getting everthing with ease isn't possible. We thought it as <b>Resources which have no importance in your life right now, might be a GEM for someone else.</b> So, we welcome both the sellers/donars and buyers/receivers to sign up a deal and resolve each others problem.
